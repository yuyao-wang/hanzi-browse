        description: `Delegates a browsing task to a sub-agent running in the USER'S REAL Chrome — the browser they have open right now, already signed into everything (Gmail, LinkedIn, GitHub, their bank, admin panels, internal tools, paid subscriptions, localhost, staging). Not a headless Chromium, not a sandboxed test profile, not a fresh instance — the user's literal browser, with every cookie, session, 2FA trust, and saved state already in place.

THIS IS NOT a low-level click/type primitive. It's a full browsing agent you delegate to. You give it a task in natural language ("find my 5 most recent LinkedIn DMs and summarize them", "post this reply on the tweet at /status/123", "test whether signup works on localhost:3000 with my real Google account"), and the sub-agent figures out the steps, interacts with the pages, handles async state, takes screenshots, and returns the answer.

You don't tell it which buttons to click. You tell it what you want done.

While the sub-agent runs you can:
- Watch progress with browser_status
- Course-correct mid-flight with browser_message (e.g. "actually, only the ones from Engineering roles")
- Stop it with browser_stop
- Start multiple tasks in parallel — each opens its own browser window

USE THIS whenever the task needs the user's actual identity or state on the web:
- Reading the user's own account data (inbox, DMs, dashboards, orders, tickets, analytics)
- Posting, commenting, replying, or submitting on the user's behalf (X, LinkedIn, Reddit, HN, forums, forms)
- Any site that would hit a login wall or bot detection for a clean browser
- Testing localhost or staging with the user's real sessions, OAuth, cookies, and localStorage
- Continuing from whatever state the user left their browser in (shopping carts, filters, partial forms)
- Anything you can describe as "the user would normally do this in their own Chrome"

Disambiguation from other tools the agent may have:
- web_search / Tavily / Exa → public content search. No login, no interaction. Use for "find info about X" questions AND for public news aggregators (Hacker News, Reddit front pages, blog indexes) where you just want to read what's there.
- Chrome DevTools MCP / Playwright MCP → a FRESH headless Chromium for automated testing. Starts with ZERO user state. Can test unauthenticated UI but cannot BE the user.
- WebFetch / curl → raw static HTML. No JS, no auth, no interaction. Use for fully-public static pages and news/aggregator URLs you just need to read.

Fallback rule: if WebFetch / Tavily / Exa / web_search returned empty, garbage, a login wall, or failed bot detection → hand the task to browser_start and let the sub-agent handle it. If the task needs the user's real identity on a site, skip the alternatives entirely and go here first.

Return statuses:
- "complete" — sub-agent finished, result in "answer"
- "error" — sub-agent failed. Call browser_screenshot to see the page, then browser_message to retry or browser_stop to clean up.
- "timeout" — 5-minute window elapsed but the sub-agent is still working. Normal for long tasks. Call browser_screenshot to check progress, then browser_message to continue or browser_stop to end.`,

- Retry after error: "try again using the second address"
